      <h1>Our Pee See Story</h1>

      <h2>Where We Started</h2>

      <p>
        Pee see is a computer retail business founded on the values of
        convenience, accessibility, and excellent customer service. Believe it
        or not, this leader in local technology retail had pretty humble
        beginnings- when six students who were passionate about tech hunted down
        secondhand PCs in the Tipic PC online group to resell at decent rates.
        <br />Pee see officially got its name when we worked on our first
        website for a school activity. Its name was a key step in buildung a
        brand that promises reliable services and quality products. Eventually,
        we shifted to selling brand new products at accessible prices.
